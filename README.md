# E-Commerce-Dashboard

I have completed this PowerBi dashboard on "Amazon Sales Analysis"
Problem statement of this project is sales management has gained importance to meet increasing competition and the need for improved methods of distribution to reduce cost and to increase profits. Sales management today is the most important function in a commercial and business enterprise.

Following steps are involved:-
*Connecting database (Using Excel)
*Analyzing tables and Relations
*Data cleaning (PowerQuery Editor)
*Data analysis
*Creating a Dashboard

I have analyzed the Amazon sales dataset and generated useful insights and visualisations in powerbi.

The  Amazon dashboard includes various key metrics, such as total revenue, units sold, average selling price. It also provides insights into product categories, top-selling products, and sales performance by geographical regions or marketplaces.

With the Amazon Sales Dashboard in Power BI, sellers can efficiently track their sales performance, identify patterns, and make data-driven decisions to optimize their Amazon business and drive profitability.
